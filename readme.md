# Life Implementations

Implementations of Conway's Game of Life in different languages, just for fun!

## C Implementation

Uses bits within a `char` to represent the alive state and number of neighbors for any given cell. Glut is used for drawing even though it's deprecated, I just wanted quick 'n dirty graphics with C! Run `make` from the project directory and you should get a binary on Linux or macOS.
